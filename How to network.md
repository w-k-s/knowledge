# How to network

## Introduction

One of my laments in life is that oftentimes when you discuss a problem with people, they don't answer the question and fail to realise that they're not answering the question. 

Nothing captures this phenomenon better than in the years following my graduating, when I was having tough time looking for a job, People would say: _"You should network, it's very effective"_. 

"True, but I'm not really sure how to do it".

_"But you have to do it, it's the best way to get noticed"_

"Okay agreed, but how do you make a good first impression"

"Nah just go in and talk, the conversation will come naturally"

Maybe that's how it goes for certain kinds of people, but I feel it's tricker for socially-awkward introverts

So the goal of this article is to provide a kind of checklist of what to do at Networking Event. It's based on what has worked well for me in my experience of attending them.

## Starting the conversation 

The difficult part about network is usually starting the conversation. Once you're talking, it's easy to continue, but finding where to start is tricky. So this is a list of opening questions:

- "Hey, how's it going?"
- "Where do you work?"
- "Oh so you work in the X industry. What kind of challenges do you face?"?
	- E.g. Scaling to manage a large number of requests, heavy volumes of data.
	- Managing costs.
	- Integrating with legacy systems.
	- Finding talent.
- "What technologies have helped you solve those challenges?"
