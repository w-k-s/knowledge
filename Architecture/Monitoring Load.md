# Monitoring Load

1. [calculating requests per second at a basic level](https://priocept.com/2009/08/21/calculating-http-server-load)

2. The SLO/SLI example accounting for latency was from https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/presentation/moyer. That talk has some really solid examples for latency and error budgets.
In further reading, the Google SRE handbook is fantastic. I'd pay special attention to the 4 'Golden signals'. https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/

3. The USE and RED methodologies are also worth understanding as outlined in https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2017/10/05/monitoring-and-observability-with-use-and-red/.
