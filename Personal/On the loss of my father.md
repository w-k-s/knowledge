# On the loss of my father

I used to put away thoughts of my parents passing away. It wasn't something I could bear to think about. 

As a child I used to pray that I'd never see either of my parents die. That didn't come true. I understand why: I'm a parent myself now; I could never truly understand how much my parents did for me if I don't go through the same journey myself.

I thought losing a parent would evoke complex emotions, but no; It's fitting that the loss of a parent evokes the simplest childlike emotion: I just feel sad.

Everyone calls me weird. My dad, though, would refer to me as "The Professor" because I'm absent-minded and lost in my own world most of the time. That still means I'm weird, but my dad found the most loving way of saying it.

My dad was a poet. He wrote a poem for every one of his children's wedding. Back in high school, when he found out that I wrote poetry and stories too, he asked me to promise him that I'd never give up on that hobby. So, I felt I had to be the one who returned his favour and write a poem about him. I'm grateful that he could read it before he passed away.

> The call for prayer sounds and as always, we walk down that narrow street,
> At first, I would hold your hand as you toddled slowly,
> Then we would stride next to each other,  father and son,
> And then you walked alone carrying me as a weight in your heart,
>
> But it is that weight that I wish to alieve,
> For have you spared a thought to consider what, amidst all adversity, you did achieve?
> You looked after your brothers and sisters, both young and old, 
> the futures of their children you secured, as though they were your very own.
> My passing was not sole and the others that followed, you helped your mother endure
>
> You travelled far away but never turned your back...
>
> Picture me as you continue down this narrow street,
> Hear my footsteps beside yours,
> Picture me now as I look towards you to say “I am proud of you, my son”
