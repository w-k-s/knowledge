# On Tech Blogging

That sh\*t is not for me! I tried it, but there's a sense of responsibility that comes with blogging; that what you write must not only be clear, but also accurate and with appropriate (and respectable) references.

This repo is called `knowledge`, I got that name from someone else who had the idea to make a repo to document their experience. If I had to come up with my own name, it would be `Bits of Paper`: alluding to this just being a collection of my rough notes. Quick scribbles and diagrams in response to questions that popped in my head. What's written is not _THE_ solution, it's _A_ solution. 

Another note about tech blogs: There are some really great blog posts out there. 

Some of them are written by people who can explain complicated things really well. 

Others introduce really interesting topics but then the rest of the post is a let down because everything is so vague and abstract. Not really a fan of those. My approach to writing this is that, God forbid, if I forget everything I'd ever learnt since graduating, I ought to be able to follow along through these notes and regain some of that experience.

> **Aside**: Now that I think about it, I could have rephrased that last sentence to read: "A fresh graduate should be able to follow these notes". That bit about memory loss was needlessly morbid.

Anyway, there's a lot of wisdom that can be learnt from experienced developers but not all experienced developers (can) take the time to write, much less also balance clarity and brevity in their writing. 

I would say the effort is worth it.
