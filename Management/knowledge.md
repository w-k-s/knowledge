## Agile/SCRUM

I've seen Agile/SCRUM done right and I've seen it done wrong. In this article, I just want to put the two experiences side-by-side.

### Stand-up

| **Bad**                                                                                                                                                                              | **Good**                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - PM put up the board and walked through each story in-progress, in test e.t.c. Unstructured discussion around each ticket                                                       | - SM didn't put the board. Each dev only answered the 3 questions: What did I do yesterday, What I will do today, Any blockers        |
| - Developers and other members of the team mentioned other stuff to keep track of during stand-up (not mentioned on the board). Team not always aware about who owns these task  | - SM always wanted to know which ticket a particular task was associated with (but not during stand-up)                               |
| - Could take up to an hour                                                                                                                                                       | - Lasted less than 5 mintues (squad of 4: 2 BE, 1 ME, 1 QA)                                                                           |
| - Team leaning against the walls or looking away as stand-up wore on                                                                                                             | - Our SM didn't ask us to stand up for Stand-Ups. The reasoning: If you know how to do a stand-up, you don't need to stand-up.        |
| - Developers nominated who went next                                                                                                                                             | - SM went first and then went clockwise (which avoided wasting time nominating and also gave everyone time to prepare what to say)    |
| - Developers went in to long technical details about their stories (even when there are no blockers)                                                                             | - This never happened; otherwise I'd like to document how the SM handled this.                                                        |
| - Developers went in to long technical details about what's blocking them                                                                                                        | - The SM cut off the developer as soon as he/she said "I'm facing an issue where.."; SM: "Okay, let's get back to that at the end..." |

## Sprint Review

| **Bad**                                                                                             | **Good**                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Developers delved into the technical details of features developed (e.g. API, JSON, Seq Diagrams) | - Devs understood the audience is non-technical. Kept the demo short, non-technical and used it as an opportunity on align team on latest features of product. |
| - One or two Developer(s) from each squad elected to present | - The dev that developed the feature presents it |
| - Seen as a chore | - SM was understanding but still promoted presenting demoes as a way to get used to senior roles where you need to present technical things to non-technical people |

## Spring Retro

I've never seen a retro done badly; I guess it's a positive thing and adds value as long as you're providing an open environment for the team to provide constructive criticism (and even get things off their chest). Here I'll just write some of the things I've experienced that made Retro's enjoyable:

| **Bad** | **Good**                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         | Starting off with a quick game e.g. Pictionary, Quiz                                                                                                                                                            |
|         | Done just before the weekend to end the week on a positive note                                                                                                                                                 |
|         | One of my SMs didn't actually hold a formal retro ceremony. He used to get bored towards the end of the day and sit with a developer to shoot the breeze, ask how things are going, how they could be improved. |

## Spring Planning/Backlog Grooming

| **Bad**                                                                                                        | **Good**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Spend half-on-hour with devs on the call figuring out which tickets in the backlog are priority.             | - SM and devs made sure the Trello backlog board was always sorted based on priority. When a features was requested, SM would sit with BA, and ask where does the story fit priority wise. (Trello didn't have epics which made things a bit confusing though) |
| - Didn't assign tickets during Grooming                                                                        | - Assigned the tickets during grooming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| - Used SCRUM pocker to esimate story points. Keep adding stories to next spring until stories = team velocity. | - No estimations; after assigning a ticket, ask the dev if they think they'll be able to complete all the stories assign to them.                                                                                                                              |

**Question**: What's the best way to break down tickets, add details.
